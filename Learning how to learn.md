## Week 1
### Summary
To simplify : metaphor and analogies
2 modes of thinking
Focused and Diffuse

Focused :
keep your thoughts concentrated
involves thinking about things you are somewhat familiar with
- Example : 
	- you're familiar with multiplication and you're trying to solve a multiplication problem, or
	- you're trying to find a word that rhymes with another word. 

-> You're probably stepping along the somewhat familiar pathways of the focused mode

Diffuse :
more broad ranging ways of thinking
used when solving or figuring out something new
- accessed when :
	- go for a walk or take a shower or even just drift off to sleep

When we find ourselves stuck on a problem, or even if we're unsure of a situation, the course of living our daily life.
It's often a good idea once you've focused directly on the situation.
To let things settle back and take a bit more time. 
That way more neural processing can take place, often below conscious awareness in the diffuse mode.

Procrastination
- The easiest way to tackle procrastination is to use the Pomodoro technique.
- That brief, 25 minute stretch of focuses concentration followed by a bit of mental relaxation. 

It's through practice and repetition that we can help enhance and
strengthen the neural structures we're building as we're learning something new. -> **Anki**
Practice and repetition is particularly important for more abstract topics.

Memory :
Short/working vs long term
Short/working -> Practice and repetition -> long term memory
-> Anki

Sleep :
We want to avoid taking tests or doing anything difficult with little sleep
the night before cause its like trying to think with poison on the brain. 

And just as importantly, exercise is surprisingly valuable in helping
both improve our memory and our ability to learn. 
## Week 2
### Intro
Chunks : Compact packages of information easily accessible
- how to form them
- how to use them to improve understanding and creativity
- how they help do better on tests
Illusion of competence : What learning methods are bad vs good
Overlearning ->-> Interleaving

### What are Chunks
---

- Summary : 
	- Chunks are concepts
	- They contain information -> which must be strongly memorised
	- Chunks need to have strong fondations, and be repeated/practiced enough to become memorised - just like the informations they contain
	- Chunks need memorised information so they can themselves become information of bigger chunks
		- Like mathematics sets ( which are collections of mathematical objects ( as from Wikipedia ) )

---

Chunking is the mental leap that helps you unite bits of information together through meaning.

#### What is a chunk?
- When you first look at a brand new concept it sometimes
doesn't make much sense
	-> like the jumbled pieces of a *chunk* of a puzzle, which connects to other parts of the bigger picture.
- Chunking is the mental leap that helps you unite bits of information together through meaning.
	- The new logical whole makes the chunk easier to remember, and also makes it easier to fit the chunk into the larger picture of what you're learning.

##### Chunking -> uniting all the info using **meaning** aka. understanding

Just memorizing a fact without understanding or context doesn't help you understand what's really going on or how the concept fits together with other concepts you're learning.

- __-> understand or know the context of a fact to be able to use it effectively__

Notice there are no interlocking puzzle edges on the puzzle piece to help you fit it to other pieces.

---

We talked earlier about working memory and how those four slots of working memory appear to hang out in the part of your brain right behind your forehead known as the prefrontal cortex.
When you're focusing your attention on something it's almost as if you have an octopus.
The octopus of attention that slips its tentacles through those four slots of working memory when necessary to help you make connections to information that you might have in various parts of your brain.

Remember, this is different from the random connections of the diffuse mode.

- Focusing your attention to connect parts of the brain to tie together ideas is an important part of the focused mode of learning.
- It is also often what helps get you started in creating a chunk.

*Interestingly when you're stressed your attentional octopus begins to lose the ability to make some of those connections.*

This is why your brain doesn't seem to work right when you're __angry__, **stressed**, or **afraid**.

---

__Chunks are pieces of information, neuroscientifically speaking, through bound together through meaning or use.__

---

Examples :
- You can take the letters P-O and P and bind them together into one conceptual easy to remember chunk, the word pop.
	- Underneath that single pop chunk is a symphony of neurons that have learned to sing in tune with one another.
- It's like converting a cumbersome computer file into a ZIP file.

The complex neural activity that ties together our simplifying abstract chunks of thought.

- Whether those thoughts pertain to acronyms, ideas, or concepts are
the basis of much of the science, literature, and art.

* Let's say you want to learn how to speak Spanish.
	- If you're a child hanging around a Spanish speaking household, learning Spanish is as natural as breathing.
		Your mother says, mama.
		And you say, mama, right back to her.

Your neurons fire and wire together in a shimmering mental loop cementing the relationship in your mind between the sound mama and your mother's smiling face. 

That scintillating neural loop is one memory trace, which is connected of course to many other related memory traces.


- The best programs for learning language, such as those of the Defense Language Institute where I learned Russian, incorporate :
	- structured practice that includes repetition and rote focus mode learning of the language 
	- And more diffuse-like free speech with native speakers.

The goal is to __embed__ the __basic words and patterns__ so you can speak as freely and creatively in your new language as you do in your native language.

- Language :
	- Words : _information_
	- Patterns : _ways of using the information (aka. words)_

As it turns out one of the first steps towards gaining expertise in academic topics is to create conceptual chunks, mental leaps that unite scattered bits of information through meaning.

The concept of neural chunks also applies to sports, music, dance, really just about anything that humans can get good at.

Basically, a chunk means a network of neurons that are used to firing together so you can think a thought or perform an action smoothly and effectively.

---

Chunks use information, they are ways of using information
	-> ==In order to __build__ chunks you need **strong fondations == memories == information**==

---

Examples :
| Information  | Chunks  |
| ------------ | ------- |
| Words        | Phrases |
| Instructions | Program |
| Moves        | Dance   |
| Inputs       | Combos  |

Kinda like combos in games - which are ways of using given moves(information) made from inputs _(which are also an information given to a computer)_

--- 

Focused practice and repetition, the creation of strong memory traces, helps you to create chunks.

==Strong basics // _(semi)permanent_ memories ->->-> Helps in creating chunks==

The path to expertise is built little by little, small chunks can become larger, and all of the expertise serves to underpin more creative interpretations as you gradually become a master of the material.

---

==As chunks become part of bigger chunks (aka become pseudo- informations/memories) -> this is the path to mastery (IMO)==

---

In other words, as you'll see later, practice and repetition in building chunks aren't all you need to become a truly creative master of the material you're learning.

==Chunking helps your brain run more efficiently.==

Once you chunk an idea, a concept, or an action, you don't know, need to remember all the little underlying details (because they are ingrained, understood).

==**Understanding == Chunking effectively/correctly**==

You've got the main idea, the chunk, and that's enough.
It's like getting dressed in the morning.
You just think one simple thought like, I'll get dressed, but it's amazing when you realise the complex swirl of underlying activities that take place with that one, simple chunk of thought.

Next, we'll talk about how you can form a chunk.

I'm Barbara Oakley.
Thanks for learning how to learn. 

End of "What is a Chunk?"

### How to form a chunk - intro

#### Music
If you're learning to play a difficult song on the guitar, the neural representation of the song in your mind can be considered as a rather large chunk.
You would first listen to the song.
Maybe you'd even watch someone else playing the song especially if you were just a beginner who was learning things like how to hold the guitar.
Getting an initial sense of the pattern you want to master for yourself is similar for most subjects or skills.
You often have to grasp little bits of songs that become neural mini chunks which will later join together into larger chunks.
For example, over several days you might learn how to smoothly play some musical passages on the guitar, and when you've grasped those passages, you could join them together with other passages that you've gradually putting everything together so you can play the song.

#### Sport
In learning a sport, say basketball, soccer, golf, you grasp and master various bits and pieces of the skills you need.
You're creating little neural mini chunks that you can then gradually knit together into larger neural chunks.
Later, you can knit those larger chunks into still larger and more complex chunks that you can draw up in an instant in reaction say to a slight shift and twist in the soccer ball that's coming your way.
The best chunks are the ones that are so well ingrained that you don't even have to consciously think about connecting the neural pattern together.
That actually is the point of making complex ideas, movements or reactions into a single chunk.

#### Language
You can see this in language learning.
In the beginning, often just saying a single word with the proper nuance, tone, and accent involves a lot of practice.
Stringing extemporaneous sentences together involves the ability to creatively mix together various complex mini chunks and chunks in the new language.

To see what I mean, try repeating the following tongue-twister in the Indian language of Kannada.
Hi, I'm Shilpa Kokeny.
I'm native speaker of Kannada, which is one of the oldest language spoken in India.
Today, I'm going to share with you a tongue-twister in Kannada.
So, let's get started.
-
Not easy, is it?
Unless you're a native speaker of Kannada, but the language was learned bit by bit.

#### Maths and science
Learning in math and science involves the same approach.

When you're learning new math and science material, you're often given __sample problems with worked out solutions__.

This is because, when you're first trying to understand how to work a problem, you have a heavy cognitive load.

__So, it helps to start out with a work-through example.__

_It's like first listening to a song before trying to play the song yourself._

Most of the details of the worked out solution are right there and your job is simply to figure out __why the steps are taken the way they are.__

They can help you see the __key features__ and __underlying principles__ of a problem.

One concern about using worked out examples in math and science to help you in starting to form chunks, is that it can be all too easy to focus too much on why an individual step works and not on the connection between steps.

-> Focus on __connections__ between steps - not the reason why an individual one works

- That is on __why__ this particular step is the next thing you should do.

So, keep in mind that I'm not just talking about a cookie cutter, just do as you're told mindless approach when following a worked-out solution.

It's more like using a roadmap to help you when traveling to a new place.

Pay attention to ==what's going on around you== (information) when you're using the map and soon you'll find yourself able to get there on your own. -> Understanding // Chunking
You'll even be able to figure out new ways of getting there. -> Creativity

---

Creativity comes from understanding which comes from having all the information you need.

Information -> Understanding // Creativity
Creativity is finding new ways of understanding using the same or more or less information.

Being creative is being able to move the pieces (chunks of informations) in new ways.

---

Next, we'll walk you through the actual steps of chunk formation.

I'm Barbara Oakley, thanks for learning how to learn.

### How to form a chunk
#### Summary 
- Chunks are best built with :
	- focused attention
	- understanding of the basic idea
	- and practice

To help you gain mastery and a sense of the big picture context.

_sometimes skipping ahead can help._

#### 1. Focus your attention on the information
- Focus your __undivided/100%__ attention on the information you want to chunk.
-  Don't be distracted

#### 2. Understand the basic idea(s)
aka. be able to repeat it.
-  Concepts
	- continental drift
	- connections of the plot of a story
	- principles of supply and demand
	- comprehending the essence of a math problem

---

Students can often synthesise the gist, that is figure out the main idea or ideas pretty naturally, or at least they can grasp those ideas if they allow the focused and diffused modes of thinking to take turns in helping them figure out what's going on.

---

Understanding is like gluing information together

A chunk without understanding is _practically_ useless

A eureka! moment, something that makes sense with an explanation from a professor must be able to be reviewed multiple times in order to stick (without the professor).

-> Testing yourself in order to check if a chunk has been correctly understood.

Just because you see it or even that you understand it, it doesn't mean that you can actually do it.

Only doing it __yourself__ helps create the neural patterns that underlie true mastery.


#### 3. Gaining context
- See how to use a chunk
- ___And also when to use a chunk__

Context means going beyond the initial problem and seeing more broadly.

Repeating and practising with both related and unrelated problems.

To be able to see when a chunk is useful __AND when it isn't__.

-> Having a tool in a (strategy or problem solving) toolbox but not knowing when to use it

Ultimately, practice helps you broaden the networks of neurons that are connected to your chunk, ensuring it's not only firm but also accessible from many different paths.

---

- Top down learning
	- Allows you to see what you're learning and where it fits in.
		- What -> Subject
		- Where it fits -> Possible (and impossible) connections

![[Pasted image 20220511002007.png]]

- Bottom up learning
	- Practise and repetition -> build and strengthen each chunk
		- Repeating each chunk in order to later incorporate them into contexts

--- 

Chunking may involve your learning __how__ to use a certain problem solving technique.

Context means learning __when__ to use that technique instead of some other technique.

How to use (chunking) with what is available (Information) and when to use it (Context).

- What -> Information
- When -> Context
- How -> Chunking 

Doing a rapid two-minute picture walk through a chapter in a book before you begin studying it, glancing at pictures and section headings can allow you to gain a sense of the big picture, so can listening to a very well-organized lecture.

Learn the major concepts or points first.
	these are often the key parts of a good instructor or on book chapters, outline, flow charts, tables, or concept maps. 

Once you have this done, fill in the details.

Even if a few of the puzzle pieces are missing at the end of your studies, you can still see the big picture.


### Illusion of competence
- The importance of :
	- Recall
	- Illusions of competence in learning.
	- Mini-testing
	- Value of making mistakes.

Recall is better than simply rereading

- After you've read the material, simply look away, and see what you can recall from the material you've just read.

Using recall, mental retrieval of the key ideas, rather than passive rereading, will make your study time more focused and effective.

The only time rereading text seems to be effective, is if you let time pass between the rereading, so that it becomes more of an exercise in spaced repetition.

If you do mark up the text, try to look for main ideas before making any marks.
And try to keep your underlining or highlighting to a minimum.
One sentence or less per paragraph.

On the other hand, words or notes in a margin that synthesize key concepts are a very good idea.

As you know now recall is a powerful tool.
But here's another tip, recalling material when you are ==outside your usual place of study== can also help you strengthen your grasp of the material.

Recall not only with Anki for example, don't do only exercises, don't repeat always the same exercise.

-> Procedural exercices !!!

That take into account what is correct, what has been tested, and what has been mistaken in order to focus on it (preferably->only after the bigger picture has been tested)

Then continue
### Active recall
Use flashcards, repeating your practice over a number of days until you can retrieve the ideas, approaches, or techniques easily from your own mind.

Good flashcard system -> ...
### Bigger picture
#### Motivation
- What is motivating ?
	- Dopamine :
		- Dopamine is in the business of predicting future rewards and not just the immediate reward.
		- When you promise to treat yourself something after a study section, you are tapping into your dopamine system.
	- Serotonin :
		- The level of serotonin is also closely linked to risk-taking behavior, with higher risk in lower serotonin monkeys.
		- Prozac raises the level of serotonin activity
	- Acetylcholine :
		- Affects focus

Emotions were once thought to be separate from cognition, but recent research has shown that emotions are intertwined with perception and attention and interact with learning and memory.

The amygdala is a part of the limbic system which, together with hippocampus, is involved in processing memory and decision-making as well as regulating emotional reactions.

You will want to keep your amygdala happy to be an effective learner.
#### The Value of a Library of Chunks

Chunks can help you understand new concepts through a process called **transfer**

Basically, what people do to enhance their knowledge and gain expertise, is to gradually build the number of chunks in their mind, valuable bits of information they can piece together in new and creative ways.

Chunks can also help you understand new concepts.

This is because when you grasp one chunk, you'll find that that chunk can be related in surprising ways to similar chunks, not only in that field but also in very different fields. 

When you're trying to figure something out, if you have a good library of these chunks, you can more easily skip to the right solution by metaphorically speaking, listening to whispers from your diffuse mode.
Your diffuse mode can help you connect two or more chunks together in new ways to solve novel problems

In building a chunked library, you're training your brain to recognize not only a specific concept, but different types and classes of concepts so that you can automatically know how to solve quickly or handle whatever you encounter.

There are two ways to figure something out or to solve problems.
- First, through sequential step-by-step reasoning
	- Sequential thinking where each small step leads deliberately towards a solution, involves the focused mode.
- second, through a more holistic intuition.
	- Intuition on the other hand, often seems to require this creative diffuse mode linking of several seemingly different focused mode thoughts.

Most difficult problems and concepts are grasped through intuition, because these new ideas make a leap away from what you're familiar with.

Keep in mind that the diffuse modes, semi-random way of making connections means that the solutions it provides should be very carefully verified using the focused mode.

Intuitive insights aren't always correct.

This is where the law of Serendipity comes into play, Lady Luck favors the one who tries.

Just focus on whatever section you're studying.

You'll find that once you put that first problem or concept in your mental library, whatever it is, then the second concept will go in a little more easily and the third more easily still.

Not that all of this is a snap, but it does get easier.
#### Overlearning, Choking, Einstellung, Chunking, and Interleaving
- Overlearning :
	- The reality is, once you've got the basic idea down during a session, continuing to hammer away at it during the same session doesn't strengthen the kinds of long term memory connections you want to have strengthened.
	- Worse yet, focusing on one technique is a little like learning carpentry by only practicing with a hammer.
	- Using a subsequent study session to repeat what you're trying to learn is just fine and often valuable.
	- It can strengthen and deepen your chunked neuron patterns.
	- This focusing on the more difficult material is called deliberate practice. 
	- It's often what makes the difference between a good student and a great student.
- Choking :
	- Overlearning is good to create automatisms that counter choking
- Einstellung :
	- You have to unlearn your erroneous older ideas or approaches even while you're learning new ones.
	- Understanding how to obtain real solutions is important in learning and in life.
- Chunking :

##### Interleaveing
Once you have the basic idea of the technique down during your study session, sort of like learning to ride a bike with training wheels, start interleaving your practice with problems of different types or different types of approaches, concepts, procedures.

Sometimes this can be a little tough to do.

A given section in a book, for example, is often devoted to a specific technique, so when you flip to that section you already know which technique you're going to be using.

Still, do what you can to mix up your learning.

In science and math in particular it can help to look ahead at the more varied problem sets that are sometimes found at the end of chapters.

Or you can deliberately try to make yourself occasionally pick out why some problems call for one technique as opposed to another.

You want your brain to become used to the idea that just knowing how to use a particular concept, approach, or problem-solving technique isn't enough.

You also need to know when to use it.

Interleaving your studies, making it a point to review for a test, for example, by skipping around through problems in the different chapters and materials can sometimes seem to make your learning a little more difficult, but in reality, it helps you learn more deeply.

Interleaving is extraordinarily important.

---

Although practice and repetition is important in helping build solid neural patterns to draw on, it's interleaving that starts building flexibility and creativity.

---

It's where you leave the world of practice and repetition, and begin thinking more independently.

When you interleave within one subject or one discipline, you begin to develop your creative power within that discipline.

When you interleave between several subjects or disciplines, you can more easily make interesting new connections between chunks in the different fields, which can enhance your creativity even further.

Of course it takes time to develop solid chunks of knowledge in different fields, so sometimes there's a trade off.

Developing expertise in several fields means you can bring very new ideas from one field to the other, but it can also mean that your expertise in one field or the other isn't quite as deep as that of the person who specializes in only one discipline.

On the other hand, if you develop expertise in only one discipline, you may know it very deeply but you may become more deeply entrenched in your familiar way of thinking and not be able to handle new ideas. 

Philosopher of science Thomas Kuhn discovered that most paradigm shifts in science are brought about either young people or people who were originally trained in a different discipline.

They're not so easily trapped by einstellung, blocked thoughts due to their preceding training.

And of course there's the old saying that science progresses one funeral at a time as people entrenched in the old ways of looking at things die off.

---

Finally, don't make the mistake of thinking that learning only occurs in the kinds of subjects you acquire from teachers or books.

When you teach a child how to deal effectively with a bully, or you fix a leaky faucet, or you quickly pack a small suitcase for a business trip to Hong Kong, all of these illustrate the outcomes of important aspects of learning.

Physicist Richard Feynman was inspired in his Nobel Prize-winning work by watching someone throw a dinner plate into the air in a cafeteria.

Mike Rowe of the television shows Dirty Jobs and Somebody's Gotta Do It shows how important and exciting learning can be in a variety of different, non-academic disciplines.

I'm Barbara Oakley.

Thanks for learning about learning.
#### Summary
---

When learning something, start by finding the hardest iteration of the thing, the others will be easy.

---

- Chunks : pieces of information, neuroscientifically speaking, that are bound together through use and often through meaning.
- Chunks can get bigger and more complex.
- But at the same time, they're a single easy to access item that you can fit like a ribbon into the slot on your working memory.

- Building them :
	- with focused, undivided attention
	- understanding of the basic idea
	- practice to help deepen your patterns and to help you gain big picture context

Simple recall, trying to remember the key points without looking at the page, is one of the best ways to help the chunking process along.

It seems to help build neural hooks.

They help you better understand the material.

Also try recalling material in places that are different from where you originally learned the material, so it becomes more deeply ingrained and accessible, regardless of what room you're in.

This can be very helpful for tests.

---

Transfer is the idea that a chunk you've mastered in one area can often help you much more easily learn chunks of information in different areas that can share surprising commonalities. 
Interleave your learning by practising your choice of different concepts, approach, and techniques all in one session. 
Chunks are very important, but they don't necessarily build flexibility, which is also important in becoming an expert with the material you're learning.

---

Illusions of competence in learning. 

- Test yourself
- Minimize highlighting
- Mistakes are good
- Use _deliberate practice_ (what is more difficult)

Learn to recognize when you're fooling yourself about whether you're actually learning the material. 
Test yourself frequently. 
Using little mini-tests to see whether you're actually learning the material, or whether you've been fooling yourself, thinking you're learning when you're actually not. 
Recall is actually a form of mini-testing. 
Try to avoid depending too much on highlighting, which can fool you into thinking that the material is going into your brain when it actually isn't. 

Mistakes are a good thing to make when
you're learning. 

They allow you to catch illusions of
competence.

---

Avoid practising only the easy stuff, which can bring the illusion that you've mastered the material.
Deliberately practice what you find more difficult to gain full mastery of the material.

---

Einstellung is when your initial thought, an idea you've already had in mind, or a neural pattern you've already developed well and strengthened, prevents a better idea or solution from being
found. 
Or keeps you from being flexible enough to accept new, better, or more appropriate solutions. 
The Law of Serendipity is helpful. 
Lady Luck favors the one who tries. 
Just pick one tiny thing out to learn, then another. 
Just keep trying and you'll be pleasantly surprised at the results. 

I'm Barbara Oakley. 

Thanks for learning about learning.

## Week 3
In this module, we talk about two intimately connected ideas 
procrastination and memory. 
Building solid chunks in long term memory--chunks that are easily accessible by your short term memory takes time.
This is why learning to handle procrastination is so important.
Finally, we talk about some of the best ways to access your brain’s most powerful long term memory systems.

### Introduction
This week we're going to be talking about two seemingly different ideas. Procrastination and memory.
But the two topics are intimately related. Why? Because building solid chunks of long term memory, chunks that are easily accessible by your short term memory, takes time. 
It's not the kind of thing you want to be putting off until the last minute.
You already have one good tool for procrastination. 
The pomodoro. 
That powerful 25 minute concentrated period of energized focus. 
This week we're going to fill you in with more information about how procrastination happens and simple ways to tackle it.
And this is key. 
Ways that don't take much will power, then we'll move on to talking about some of the best ways to access your brain's most powerful long-term memory systems.

I'm Barbara Oakley. 

Thanks for learning how to learn. - I want to cry each time I read this holy shit.

### Procrastination

The reason that learning to avoid procrastination is so important is that good learning is a bit by bit activity.

---

#### intro script

Arsenic is incredibly toxic. 
For centuries until modern methods of detection were discovered, murderers found it to be a very popular substance. 
So you can imagine the shock at the 48th meeting of the German Association of Arts and Sciences in 1875 when two men sat in the front of the audience and downed more than double a deadly dose of arsenic. 
The next day the men were back at the conference smiling and healthy.
How is it possible to take something so bad for you and stay alive, and even look healthy, despite the damage being done at a microscopic level to your body? 
The answer has an uncanny relationship to procrastination that's what we're going to be talking about in the next few videos.

---

You've already learned one handy tool to help you with procrastination, the Pomodoro, that 25 minute period of uninterrupted focus followed by a bit of relaxation. 

This week we're going to learn more.

Understanding a little about the cognitive psychology of procrastination, just like understanding the chemistry of poison, can help us develop healthy preventatives. 
In these videos, I'm going to teach you the lazy person's approach to tackling procrastination. 
This means you'll be learning about your inner zombies – the routine, habitual responses your brain falls into as a result of specific cues. 
These zombie responses are often focused on making the here and now better. 
As you'll see you can trick some of these zombies into helping you fend off procrastination when you need to.

Not all procrastination is bad. 
Even if you're pretty good already in handling procrastination you'll learn some helpful insights here that can allow you to better prioritize your learning. 

The reason that learning to avoid procrastination is so important is that good learning is a bit by bit activity. 

You want to avoid cramming which doesn't build solid neural structures.

By putting the same amount of time into your learning but spacing that learning out by starting earlier you'll learn better. 

First things first.

Unlike procrastination which is easy to fall into, willpower is hard to come by. 
It uses a lot of neural resources. 
You shouldn't waste willpower on fending off procrastination except when absolutely necessary. 
Best of all as you'll see you don't need to. 
If you'll remember we procrastinate about things that make us a little bit uncomfortable. 
You think about something you don't particularly like and the pain centers of your brain light up so you shift and narrow your focus of attention to something more enjoyable. 
This causes you to feel better. 
At least temporarily but sadly the long term effects of habitual avoidance can be nasty. 
When you put off your studies it can become even more painful to think about studying it. 
You can choke on tests because you haven't laid the firm neural foundations you need to feel comfortable with the material.
Procrastination can be a single monumentally important keystone bad habit, a habit in other words that influences many important areas of your life. 
If you improve your abilities in this area many other positive changes will gradually begin to unfold.
Procrastination shares features with addiction. 
It offers temporary excitement and relief from sometimes boring reality.
It's easy to fool yourself for example into thinking that the best use of any given moment is. 
Surfing the web for information instead of actually reading the textbook or doing the assigned problems. 
You start to tell yourself stories. 
For example you might tell yourself that organic chemistry requires special reasoning, your weakness, so of course you're doing very poorly at it. 
You devise irrational excuses that sound superficially reasonable like if I study too far ahead of the test I'll forget the material. 
If you're troubled by procrastination you may even start telling yourself that procrastination is an innate unchangeable characteristic. 
After all if procrastination were easily fixable wouldn't you have fixed it by now?
The higher you go in your studies however the more important it is to take control of procrastination.
Habits that worked in earlier years can turn around and bite you. 
What I'll show you in these next few videos is how you can become the master of your habit. 
You should be making the decisions, not your well-meaning but unthinking zombies, your habits. 
As you'll see, the strategies for dealing with procrastination are simple. It's just that sometimes they aren't intuitively obvious.
So let's return to that story that began this video. 
The arsenic eaters started with tiny doses of arsenic.
In tiny doses, arsenic doesn't seem harmful. 
You can even build up an immunity to its effects. 

This can allow you to take larger doses and look healthy, even as the poison is slowly increasing your risk of cancer and ravaging your organs.
In a similar way procrastinators put off just that one little thing.
