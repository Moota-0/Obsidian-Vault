### Summary

Here again are the twenty rules of formulating knowledge. You will notice that the first 16 rules revolve around making memories simple! Some of the rules strongly overlap. For example: do not learn if you do not understand is a form of applying the minimum information principle which again is a way of making things simple:
1. Do not learn if you do not understand
2. Learn before you memorize - build the picture of the whole before you dismember it into simple items. If the whole shows holes, review it again!
3. Build upon the basics - never jump both feet into a complex manual because you may never see the end. Well remembered basics will help the remaining knowledge easily fit in
4. Stick to the minimum information principle - if you continue forgetting an item, try to make it as simple as possible. If it does not help, see the remaining rules (cloze deletion, graphics, mnemonic techniques, converting sets into enumerations, etc.)
5. Cloze deletion is easy and effective - completing a deleted word or phrase is not only an effective way of learning. Most of all, it greatly speeds up formulating knowledge and is highly recommended for beginners
6. Use imagery - a picture is worth a thousand words
7. Use mnemonic techniques - read about peg lists and mind maps. Study the books by Tony Buzan. Learn how to convert memories into funny pictures. You won't have problems with phone numbers and complex figures
8. Graphic deletion is as good as cloze deletion - obstructing parts of a picture is great for learning anatomy, geography and more
9. Avoid sets - larger sets are virtually un-memorizable unless you convert them into enumerations!
10. Avoid enumerations - enumerations are also hard to remember but can be dealt with using cloze deletion
11. Combat interference - even the simplest items can be completely intractable if they are similar to other items. Use examples, context cues, vivid illustrations, refer to emotions, and to your personal life
12. Optimize wording - like you reduce mathematical equations, you can reduce complex sentences into smart, compact and enjoyable maxims
13. Refer to other memories - building memories on other memories generates a coherent and hermetic structure that forgetting is less likely to affect. Build upon the basics and use planned redundancy to fill in the gaps
14. Personalize and provide examples - personalization might be the most effective way of building upon other memories. Your personal life is a gold mine of facts and events to refer to. As long as you build a collection for yourself, use personalization richly to build upon well established memories
15. Rely on emotional states - emotions are related to memories. If you learn a fact in the sate of sadness, you are more likely to recall it if when you are sad. Some memories can induce emotions and help you employ this property of the brain in remembering
16. Context cues simplify wording - providing context is a way of simplifying memories, building upon earlier knowledge and avoiding interference
17. Redundancy does not contradict minimum information principle - some forms of redundancy are welcome. There is little harm in memorizing the same fact as viewed from different angles. Passive and active approach is particularly practicable in learning word-pairs. Memorizing derivation steps in problem solving is a way towards boosting your intellectual powers!
18. Provide sources - sources help you manage the learning process, updating your knowledge, judging its reliability, or importance
19. Provide date stamping - time stamping is useful for volatile knowledge that changes in time
20. Prioritize - effective learning is all about prioritizing. In incremental reading you can start from badly formulated knowledge and improve its shape as you proceed with learning (in proportion to the cost of inappropriate formulation). If need be, you can review pieces of knowledge again, split it into parts, reformulate, reprioritize, or delete.

### Personnal Notes

1. Do not learn if you do not understand
2. Learn before you memorize
	- build an overall picture of the learned knowledge
	- First read a chapter in your book that puts facts together
	- then proceed with learning using individual questions and answers
3. Build upon the basics
	- Make a simple picture of the whole
	- Memorize obvious things!
	- Basics are volatile and the cost of memorizing easy things is little.
	- Basics take a tiny proportion of your time. 
	- However, each memory lapse on a basic fact can be very costly!
4.  Stick to the minimum information principle
	-  The material you learn must be formulated in as simple way as it is only possible.
		- **Simple is easy**
		- **Repetitions of simple items are easier to schedule**
			- split the complex item into sub-items, each can be repeated at its own pace saving your time.
			- inexperienced students create items that could easily be split into **ten or more** simpler sub-items!
			- Although the number of items increases, the number of repetitions of each item will usually be small enough to greatly outweigh the cost of
				1.  forgetting the complex item again and again
				2. repeating it in excessively short intervals
				3. actually remembering it only in part!
			- Exemple
				- -formulated knowledge - Complex and wordy
				  Q: What are the characteristics of the Dead Sea?  
				  A: Salt lake located on the border between Israel and Jordan. Its shoreline is the lowest point on the Earth's surface, averaging 396 m below sea level. It is 74 km long. It is seven times as salty (30% by volume) as the ocean. Its density keeps swimmers afloat. Only simple organisms can live in its saline waters
				- Well-formulated knowledge - Simple and specific
				  Q: Where is the Dead Sea located?  
				  A: **on the border between Israel and Jordan**
				  Q: What is the lowest point on the Earth's surface?  
				  A: **The Dead Sea shoreline**
				  Q: What is the average level on which the Dead Sea is located?  
				  A: **400 meters** (below sea level)
				  Q: How long is the Dead Sea?  
				  A: **70 km**
				  Q: How much saltier is the Dead Sea as compared with the oceans?  
				  A: **7 times**
				  Q: What is the volume content of salt in the Dead Sea?  
				  A: **30%**
				  Q: Why can the Dead Sea keep swimmers afloat?  
				  A: **due to high salt content**
				  Q: Why is the Dead Sea called Dead?  
				  A: **because only simple organisms can live in it**
				  Q: Why only simple organisms can live in the Dead Sea?  
				  A: **because of high salt content**
		- **the longer the time you need to remember knowledge, the more you benefit from simplifying your items**!
		- **We want answer to be as short as imaginably possible**!
		- Additionally, rounding 396 to 400 and 74 to 70 produces some loss of information. 
		  These can be remedied by adding more questions or making the present ones more precise.
5. Close deletion is easy and effective
	-  _Cloze deletion_ is a sentence with its parts missing and replaced by three dots.
		- For example, _Bill ...[name] was the second US president to go through impeachment._
	- If you are a beginner and if you find it difficult to stick to the minimum information principle, use cloze deletion!
	- It is a quick and effective method of converting textbook knowledge into knowledge that can be subject to learning based on spaced repetition.
	- Exemple :
		- Ill-formulated knowledge - Complex and wordy
		  Q: What was the history of the Kaleida company?
		  A: Kaleida, funded to the tune of $40 million by Apple Computer and IBM in 1991. Hyped as a red-hot startup, Kaleida's mission was to create a multimedia programming language It finally produced one, called Script X. But it took three years. Meanwhile, companies such as Macromedia and Asymetrix had snapped up all the business. Kaleida closed in 1995
		- **Well-formulated knowledge - Simple cloze deletion**

		  A: 1995
6.  Use imagery
	-  Q: What African country is located between Kenya, Zambia and Mozambique?  
	  A: Tanzania
	  More effective formulation
	  Q: What African country is marked white on the map?  
	      ![Tanzania](http://super-memory.com/images/tanzania.gif)  
    A: Tanzania
7. Use mnemonic techniques
	-  _mind maps_, _peg lists_, _mnemonic techniques_, etc.
8. Graphic deletion is as good as cloze deletion
	-  A more detailed recipe for creating occlusion tests is presented in: [Flow of knowledge](http://super-memory.com/articles/flow.htm)
9.  Avoid sets
	-  If sets are absolutely necessary, you should always try to convert them into [enumerations](http://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm#Enumerations).
	- the great advantage of enumerations over sets is that they are ordered and they force the brain to list them always in the same order.
	- **you should always try to make sure your brain works in the exactly same way at each repetition**
	- [techniques for dealing with enumerations](http://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm#Enumerations)
10. Avoid enumerations
	-   If you cannot avoid them, deal with them using [cloze deletions](http://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm#Cloze deletion) (overlapping cloze deletions if possible).
11. Combat interference
	- make items as unambiguous as possible
	- stick to the [minimum information principle](http://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm#minimum information principle) (many of the remaining rules in this text are based on avoiding interference!)
	- eliminate interference as soon as you spot it, i.e. before it becomes your obsession (e.g. as soon as you see the word **_inept_** you think "_I know the meanings of **inept** and **inapt** but I will never know which is which!"_)
	- in SuperMemo use **[View](http://super-memory.com/help/view.htm) : Other browsers : [Leeches](http://super-memory.com/help/leech.htm)** (_Shift+F3_) to regularly review and **eliminate** most difficult items
	-   read more: [Memory interference](http://super-memory.com/english/ol/ks.htm#Univocality)
12. Optimise wording 
	- The wording of your items must be optimized to make sure that in minimum time the right bulb in your brain lights up.
		- This will reduce error rates, increase specificity, reduce response time, and help your concentration.
	- Less optimum item: cloze deletion that is too wordy
	
	Q: Aldus invented desktop publishing in 1985 with PageMaker. Aldus had little competition for years, and so failed to improve. Then Denver-based ... blew past. PageMaker, now owned by Adobe, remains No.
	A: Quar
	
	Better item: fewer words will speed up learning
	
	Q: Aldus invented desktop publishing in 1985 with PageMaker but failed to improve. Then ... blew past (PageMaker remains No. 2
	A: Quar
	
	Or better
	
	Q: Aldus invented desktop publishing with PageMaker but failed to improve. It was soon outdistanced by ..
	A: Quar
	
	Or better
	
	Q: PageMaker failed to improve and was outdistanced by ..
	A: Quar
	
	Or better
	
	Q: PageMaker lost ground to ..
	A: Quark 

13. Refer to other memories
	- Referring to other memories can place your item in a better context, simplify wording, and reduce interference.
		- Item subject to strong interference
			- Q: derog: adj: shamelessly conscious of one's failings and asking in a begging way  
			- A: cringing
		- Item that uses interfering memories to amplify the correct meaning (the words humble and supplicant need to be learned before or at the same time)
			- Q: derog: adj: shamelessly humble and supplicant  
			- A: cringing
14. Personalise and provide examples
	- One of the most effective ways of enhancing memories is to provide them with a link to your personal life.
	- Personalized examples are very resistant to [interference](http://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm#Interference) and can greatly reduce your learning time
15. Rely on emotional states
	- If you can illustrate your items with examples that are vivid or even shocking, you are likely to enhance retrieval
	- however, you should make sure that you are not deprived of the said emotional clues at the moment when you need to retrieve a given memory in a real-life situation
16.  Context cues simplify wording
	- provide different branches of knowledge with a different look (different [template](http://super-memory.com/help/templates.htm)), use reference labels (_Title, Author, Date,_ etc.) and clearly label subcategories (e.g. with strings such as _chem_ for _chemistry_, _math_ for _mathematics_, etc.).
	- This will help you simplify the wording of your items as you will be relieved from the need to specify the context of your question.
	- Useful when using abbreviations
	- Q: What does GRE stand for in biochemistry? -> Q: bioch: GRE
	  A: glucocorticoid response element
17. Redundancy does not contradict minimum information principle
	- **passive and active approach**
		- When learning a language -> pairs **AND** reversed/swaped pairs
	- **reasoning cues**
		- you will often want to boost your reasoning ability by asking about a solution to the problem. 
		- Instead of just memorizing the answer you would like to quickly follow the reasoning steps (e.g. solve a simple mathematical equation) and generate the answer. 
		- In such a case, providing the hint on the reasoning steps in the answer will only serve helping you always follow the right path at repetitions
	- **derivation steps**
		- in more complex problems to solve, memorizing individual derivation steps is always highly recommended
		- For more on boosting creativity and intelligence read: [Roots of genius and creativity](http://super-memory.com/articles/genius.htm), as well as more specific: [Derivation, reasoning and intelligence](http://super-memory.com/english/ol/ks.htm#Intelligence)
	- **multiple semantic representation**
		- Memorizing different representations of the same fact or rule is recommended in cases where a given memory is of high value.
	- **flexible repetition**
		- if there are many valid responses to the same question make sure that your representation makes it possible to identify the equivalence and reward you with good grades by providing just one of the equivalent choices.
		- For example, if you learn a language, it rarely make sense to learn all synonyms that meet a definition of a concept. It is more adequate to consider a single synonym as the sufficient answer (e.g. _a mark made by ink spilt on sth_ = _blot/blob/blotch_)
	- [**more**](http://super-memory.com/english/ol/ks.htm#Redundancy)
18. Provide sources
	- Except for well-tested and proven knowledge (such as _2+2=4_), it is highly recommended that you include sources from which you have gathered your knowledge.
19.  Provide date stamping
	- Knowledge can be relatively stable (basic math, anatomy, taxonomy, physical geography, etc.) and highly volatile (economic indicators, high-tech knowledge, personal statistics, etc.)
	- In case of statistical figures, you might stamp them with the year they have been collected.
	- When learning software applications, it is enough you stamp the item with the software version.
20.  Prioritize
	-  **Prioritizing sources**
	- **Extracting knowledge**
		- marking paragraphs in a book or journal
		- pasting relevant web pages
		- pasting relevant passages
		- typing facts and figures
	- **Transferring knowledge**
		- Probably the best criterion for choosing between formulating or just importing is the time needed for accurately formulating the item or items
			- If formulation requires more knowledge, more time, comparing with other sources, etc. you can just import
			- Otherwise, if you believe that formulating an accurate item is a matter of seconds, formulate it
	- **Formulating items**
		- explanatory or optional components of the answer are placed in the parentheses
		- The parts in the parentheses can be read after the repetition to strengthen the memory in its context
	- **Using forgetting index**
		- Automatic in anki
	- **Learning**
